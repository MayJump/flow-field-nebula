Flow-Field Nebula – Interactive Generative Art
What you’re seeing isn’t a video or an animation file.
It’s code—drawing thousands of tiny particles in real time, each one following invisible currents in a “flow field.”

A flow field is a kind of mathematical wind map.
Every particle reads the field like a compass, turning slightly based on a noise function (a smooth, random pattern).
This makes them swirl, curl, and drift into organic shapes—like clouds, smoke, or galaxies.

Your browser is doing all the work:

Every frame, each particle moves a small step in its assigned direction.
The path is drawn in soft colors from a randomly chosen palette.
Old frames fade gently, leaving dreamy trails.
Controls:
1, 2, 3 → Switch between preset motion styles (energy levels and curliness).
R → Reseed the flow field for a new particle arrangement.
C → Change the color palette.
P → Pause the animation.
S → Save a screenshot as a PNG image.
Because this is pure math and drawing instructions, every run is unique—no two nebulae will ever be exactly the same.
